## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Bank System** developed in C++. Initially, the system supported only customer operations without user management or login functionality. Over time, the project was enhanced to include:

- **User Management**: Added users with specific permissions.
- **Login System**: Implemented a secure login mechanism.
- **Visitor Management**: Tracked and managed visitors.

The most challenging part was implementing user permissions using **bitwise operators**. While simpler methods existed, the project required using bitwise operations, and I was determined to master them.

## 🔑 Key Features
### 👤 User Roles and Permissions
- Each user has specific permissions managed using **bitwise operators**.  
*(Inspired by the video: "Bitwise Operators in C++")*

### 🔒 Login System
- A secure login functionality to protect access to the system.

### 🕴️ Visitor Management
- Tracks and manages visitors within the bank system.

## 🧪 How to Test
To test all authorized functionalities, use the following credentials:

| Field      | Value        |
|------------|--------------|
| **Username** | HazemYahea   |
| **Password** | 12212345     |
