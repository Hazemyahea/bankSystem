Bank System Project
Final Project for Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3
ProgrammingAdvices

Project Overview
This project is a Bank System developed in C++. Initially, the system only supported customer operations without any user management or login functionality. Over time, the project was enhanced to include:

User Management: Added users with specific permissions.

Login System: Implemented a secure login mechanism.

Visitor Management: Tracked and managed visitors.

The most challenging part was implementing user permissions using bitwise operators. While there were simpler ways to achieve this, I insisted on using bitwise operations as required.

Key Features
User Roles and Permissions:
Each user has specific permissions managed using bitwise operators.
(This was inspired by the video: Bitwise Operators in C++)

Login System:
Secure login functionality to protect access to the system.

Visitor Management:
Track and manage visitors within the bank system.

How to Test
To test all authorized functionalities, use the following credentials:

Username: HazemYahea

Password: 12212345

Lessons Learned
Gained a deeper understanding of bitwise operators and their practical applications.

Learned how to implement role-based access control in a system.

Improved problem-solving skills by tackling complex requirements.
